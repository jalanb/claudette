# Project Tasks

## Documentation Tasks

- [x] Implement ADR structure for documenting decisions
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md to reference context.md
- [ ] Create custom ADR template for AI-human collaboration
- [x] Determine process for session context preservation
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md to specify commit messages must be reviewed before execution
- [x] Standardize date format to ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Develop a Capability Boundary Framework defining which tasks AI can handle independently vs requiring human involvement (highest priority)
- [ ] Create a simple Knowledge Repository format for domain-specific terminology and concepts
- [ ] Develop templates for structured documentation (prioritized in tiers):
  - Tier 1 (Immediate): 
    - [ ] Project Constraints Document
    - [ ] Interpretation Confirmation Protocol
  - Tier 2 (Secondary):
    - [ ] Code Quality Specification
    - [ ] Feedback Framework
  - Tier 3 (Future):
    - [ ] Error Reporting Template
    - [ ] Cross-Functional Impact Matrix
    - [ ] Capability Verification Protocol
    - [ ] Complexity Estimation Framework

## Open Questions

- [ ] How to determine which decisions are "significant" enough for ADRs
- [ ] How to balance completeness with conciseness in context preservation
- [ ] What threshold should we use for documenting chat decisions?
- [ ] How might learning principles be incorporated into documentation to help users adapt gradually?
- [ ] How can we add "theory of mind" capabilities to future versions to better track user learning/adaptation?
- [ ] Which collaboration issues from the analysis are most relevant to command-line contexts vs web interfaces?

## Next Steps

- [x] Add task tracking section to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Update context.md with latest status and decisions
- [ ] Read AI-human collaboration documents in depth, focusing specifically on Claude Code usage patterns
- [ ] Evaluate and reorder problems from the collaboration analysis by our own criteria of "what can we help with NOW?"
- [ ] Consider prioritization approaches for TODO.md as it expands
- [ ] Develop methodology for extracting concrete plans (daily/weekly/monthly) from task list
