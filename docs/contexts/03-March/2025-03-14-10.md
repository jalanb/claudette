### Key Decisions

1. **Conversation-based task tracking format**
   - Created TODO.md using markdown checkbox syntax
   - Format distinguishes between open and completed tasks
   - Focus on capturing tasks that emerge during conversations
   - Avoid duplicating external tracking systems
   - Selected for simplicity and compatibility with existing documentation

2. **Updated commit message guidelines**
   - All commit messages must be shown for review before execution
   - Added commit guidelines section to CLAUDE.md
   
3. **Simplified commit message attribution format**
   - Removed emoji, URL, and email address from Claude-authored commits
   - Changed wording from "Generated with Claude Code" to "Committed by Claude Code"
   - Documented in ADR-0004
