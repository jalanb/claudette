### Key Decisions

1. **Expanded scope based on AI-human collaboration research**
   - Reviewed detailed analysis of AI-human collaboration issues and solutions
   - Identified key templates and frameworks to implement
   - Prioritized solutions by solvability and significance
   - Focus on practical, immediately implementable improvements

2. **Prioritized implementation approach**
   - Capability Boundary Framework identified as highest priority deliverable
   - Templates categorized into three tiers for phased implementation
   - Emphasized importance of demonstrating practical benefits over theoretical explanations
   - Acknowledged limits of current AI "theory of mind" capabilities

3. **Updated task tracking**
   - Expanded TODO.md with new tasks derived from collaboration analysis
   - Added prioritization tiers to documentation template tasks
   - Added new open questions about learning theory and user adaptation
   - Recognized need for better task prioritization as list expands
