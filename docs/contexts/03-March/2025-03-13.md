### Key Decisions

1. **Separated documentation concerns**
   - Created README.md for human-oriented project information
   - Refactored CLAUDE.md to focus exclusively on AI collaboration guidance
   - Removed Python style guide (YAGNI)

2. **Commit message conventions**
   - No emojis in commit messages
   - Use "Generated by Claude" for attributing AI contributions
   - Different attribution might be needed when content is collaborative
   - All commit messages must be shown for review before execution

3. **Context preservation approach**
   - Selected Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as primary documentation method
   - Will use sequential numbering (purely as identifiers, not implying hierarchy)
   - Value capturing rejected alternatives, not just chosen approaches
   - Will create custom ADR template for AI-human collaboration
   - Decided tools like adr-tools are suitable (CLI-based is preferred)
