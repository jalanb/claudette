# Project Conventions

This document outlines the various conventions used throughout the J&J Stock project to maintain consistency and clarity.

## TODO Format

In our TODO.md and other task lists, we use the following checkbox states:

- `[ ]` - Not started/to do
- `[x]` - Completed/done
- `[-]` - Won't do/canceled/skipped
- `[~]` - In progress/partially done
- `[>]` - Deferred/postponed
- `[!]` - Important/urgent
- `[?]` - Under consideration/unclear
- `[/]` - Partially completed
- `[o]` - In review/waiting for approval

These visual indicators provide quick status assessment while maintaining the familiar checkbox format.

## Additional Conventions

*Future conventions will be documented in additional sections here as needed.*
