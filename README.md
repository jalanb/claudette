# CLAUDE.md Project

A research project aimed at developing the most effective CLAUDE.md structure and content for AI-assisted development.

## Purpose

This project explores how to create optimal CLAUDE.md files that:

1. Provide clear guidance to Claude AI assistants
2. Standardize project conventions
3. Improve collaboration between humans and AI
4. Document effective patterns and anti-patterns

## Getting Started

Simply clone this repository to experiment with different CLAUDE.md approaches:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jalanb/claudette.git
cd claudette
```

## What is CLAUDE.md?

CLAUDE.md is a special file that Claude AI automatically includes in its context when present in a working directory. It serves as a project-specific instruction set, providing guidance on:

- Project purpose and context
- Coding and documentation standards
- Collaboration workflows
- Documentation requirements
- And more

## Project Goals

- Determine optimal CLAUDE.md structure and content
- Identify what information is most helpful to include
- Develop templates for different project types
- Document effective patterns discovered through experimentation

## Contributing

This is an evolving project. To contribute:

1. Experiment with different CLAUDE.md approaches
2. Document what works well and what doesn't
3. Submit pull requests with improvements
